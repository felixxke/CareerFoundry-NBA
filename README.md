# CareerFoundry-NBA

Repository of Python Scripts for my NBA Analysis project completed through CareerFoundry's Data Analytics Program.

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in North America comprising of 30 franchises, of which 29 are located in the United States and one in Canada. It is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and is considered the premier professional basketball league in the world. The league was founded in 1946, then named the Basketball Association of America (BAA). In 1949, the BAA merged with the rival National Basketball League (NBL) to form the NBA. The NBA's regular season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games. The league's playoff tournament extends into June, which decides the NBA champions of that season.

For our project we are investigating the relationship between an NBA player's height and weight, and whether there is a difference in these attributes between player positions in the NBA.

We are using an external data source from Kaggle for our case study. It is from publicly collected data on NBA games and is updated daily by the owner. This data is provided through stats.nba.com via the nba api. Since it is from the official nba website, we can believe it to be trustworthy.
